The IMAP server is now configured by default to use its built-in SSL
support instead of using stunnel.  Accordingly, the name of the
certificate file in @@SSLCERTS@@ has changed from stunnel.pem
to imapd.pem.  Users upgrading from previous releases will need to
rename, copy, or create a symbolic link to their existing certificate.
